# BlackJack

Sometimes we want to do something somewhat productive, such as learning a new skill while also having fun.  

There are two easy ways to add this to path:

1. Add the blackjack.sh file to /bin/ directory

2. If you don't want to modify your system binaries (which you probably shouldn't), you can make a bin file in the home directory.  To add the directory to path type export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH".  From there simply add the blackjack.sh file to ~/bin/
